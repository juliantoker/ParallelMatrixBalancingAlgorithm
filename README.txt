This is a parallelized matrix balancing algorithm I developed as part of my research at St.Vincent College.
It utilizes the SMP hardware architecture and is a parallel version of the original matrix balancing algorithm
developed by E.E. Osbourne in his work "On pre-conditioning of matrices." Matrices preconditioned with this algorithm
have condition numbers averaging from 10 - 100 smaller than before preconditioning. This greatly reduces the round off
errors associated with operations on the matrix.
